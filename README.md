## Overview

**Duration:** 1 day

**Repository:** [learning-sass](https://github.com/your-username/learning-sass)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the advantages of using SASS to write CSS code.
- Gain hands-on experience with writing SASS code.

## Introduction

SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a powerful frontend development tool that allows you to generate CSS from a language similar to CSS, but with enhanced features. By using SASS to write your stylesheets, you can improve your workflow efficiency, code reusability, and code readability through features such as variables and mixins.


### SASS Presentation

Official Site: [SASS - http://sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com)

### Setup

When you save a SASS file, it will automatically generate the corresponding CSS file. In Visual Studio Code, the "Live Sass Compiler" extension will help for a straightforward setup. Otherwise, follow the installation instructions on the [official SASS website](https://sass-lang.com/install). After installation, using the terminal we can type `sass -v` to ensure that the latest version installed.

### Steps

1. Creating a basic HTML file named `index.html` to provide a starting point for the project.
2. Creating a folder named `assets`. This folder will house all static files required for the visual design of your interface, such as images, CSS, JavaScript, fonts, and more. The "assets" folder structure has become a convention among frontend developers for organizing project resources.
3. Creating a `style.scss` file within the "assets" folder. Configuring the SASS application to automatically generate a `style.css` file whenever the "source" file (`style.scss`) is modified.
4. Ensuring the HTML file contains a `<link rel="stylesheet" ...>` element referencing the `style.css` file (not the `.scss` file).

### Experiment with Basic SASS Features

Now that it's all set up,  we'll experiment with some of the fundamental SASS features, such as variables, mixins, and nesting, to get a feel for how SASS can streamline your CSS development.

## Conclusion

By completing this exercise, we'll learn the benefits of using SASS for writing your CSS code. From this point forward, incorporating SASS into every project will enhance development experience. With better writting, less frustration:
